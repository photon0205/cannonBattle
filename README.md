# cannonBattle

#Introduction
This is a Multiplayer web-game in which you have to launch a cannon in order to strike the opponent and the one with most number of strikes will win having more points.
I have used web-sockets to make this Multiplayer. Also you can see the highscore going on in the game.



#Server

You have to install express and sockets in the server directory using
'npm install express' 
and 
'npm install socket.io'.
Sockets are used to communicate with other users using the 'emit' command.
You can start the server using 'npm start'.




#Starting-the-application

First of all click on the user you want to play as i.e. user1 or user2 anf then the more you strike the other user, the more will be your points.




#Controls

You will have to fight with the opponent for 30 seconds. You can control your props as following:
'UpArrow' : move the carriage up
'DownArrow' : move the carriage down
'w' : to move the barrel up
's' : to move the barrel down
'space' : to fire the cannon
